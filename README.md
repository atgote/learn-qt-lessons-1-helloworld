# learn-qt-lessons-1-helloworld

This is a modified "Hello QT!" example from the "C++ GUI programming with Qt 4".

In order to test formatting options, available for the QLabel widget use an html
file (like test.html) in this repository and run app as follows:

$ ./HelloWorld "`cat test.html`"

this will insert contents of the test.html file into the first command-line 
argument for the program and it will be used as the greetings text in the app.
